# Example app for integration of a Weather API service

This app demonstrates how a custom weather API service can be integrated and accessed via Ephedra. As a use-case we query the geo-coordinates from the Wikidata knowledge graph, and display the three day forecast for the corresponding location.

A full tutorial describing the setup and scenario in detail is available [here](../tutorials/weather/weather.md).

The basic example is available on http://localhost:10214/resource/?uri=http://www.example.org/WeatherDemo

In case the wikidata app is installed, the integration example for Portoroz can be found on http://localhost:10214/resource/wd:Q564988
